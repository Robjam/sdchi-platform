## Prerequesites

This makes heavy usage of https in local development, and for the convenient `scripts/setup-https.sh` script to work, the following dependencies must be installed (by brew):

```
brew install mkcert nss
```

next run the script from the root directory (same directory as this README.md):
```
sudo ./scripts/setup-https.sh
```
